# One App a Month

Way too often we build amazing things but forget to make them accessible to the world and charge for our work. This is a competition between friends to help remember us of our developer duties :)

## Rules

1. By the end of each month you must publish an app
2. The app must have not been published before
3. The app must solve a problem of yourself, a friend or someone you know personally
4. The app must be publicly accessible
5. Everyone must be able to pay to use the app or parts of it
6. The app must be listed in this repositories list of apps

If one of the rules above is broken by any participant of this competition he shall pay 50â‚¬ to fund common joy among all contestants once in a while.
